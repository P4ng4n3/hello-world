# hello-world
This is where my journey begins.

Hi All!

My name is Pangane, I think that many things are possible if you put the right effort into it. I recently start learning to code for personal development and it has been an excellent experience. I always love network and hate code, but since I start learning to code I can see my self doing this for the rest of my life... I love the fact that I only need my ideas and my computer to code. Until this point I don't have preference in any language, I think that any language that works for what I want to build it's perfect in that momment.
